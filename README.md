# Pokémon Unity Wiki

Obsolete as of 7/31/2019. The information contained in this repository *MAY OR MAY* NOT be accurate anymore!
This resource will provide documentation for the Pokémon Unity Framework. (abbv. as 'PkUnity' or 'PkU')
Tutorials are included for complicated steps in the development process such as working with Tiled2PKUnity or creating models for tilemaps in Blender. Alongside tutorials, there will be documentation on global functions such as modifying debug data. There will also be instructions for changes made in the develop branch if you're using develop over master.

This GitBook is currently a work in progress, though we hope to update it regularly since the develop branch is including new additions. Voluntary additions are always welcome via Change Requests.

Thanks for using PKUnity,
The Pokémon Unity Team
